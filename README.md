# meal-planner-with-shopping-list

Every few weeks I get in a rut feeling like we eat the same food all the time or I can't think of what to cook. This app will allow me to plan dinners and add them to my calendar so I can easily go back for ideas on things to cook again as well as letting my family know what I plan to cook for the week. I am adding a shopping list feature to help generate a shopping list for the planned dinners for the week. 

#Update- I couldn't get the original plan for this app to work so I made some changes. I originally created a google sheets document with recipes that I planned to add to my google calendar. I couldn't get that to work, so I decided to create code that will pull recipes I want to use from the original google sheet to a new one based on the protein I have on hand. I will then have a list of recipes to chose from and manually add to my calendar.
